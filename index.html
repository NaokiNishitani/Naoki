							She experienced the Great Hanshin Earthquake when she was 55 years old. Although her home and the building she owns remained safe, her life continued to be inconvenient for a while. When her children became adults, she lived with her husband for a while, but her husband developed dementia and had to live in care. Her three children are all married and have 6 grandchildren.
